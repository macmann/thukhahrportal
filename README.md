# Atenxion Post-Login Sync Integration

This project now triggers Atenxion's background synchronization as part of the existing Brillar HR Portal login flow. After a user authenticates successfully, the browser immediately queues a non-blocking POST request to Atenxion QA so that the portal can stay responsive while downstream systems synchronize.

## How it works

- The login form in [`public/index.html`](public/index.html) submits to the local `/login` endpoint handled by the Node.js server (`server.js`).
- When authentication succeeds, [`public/index.js`](public/index.js) stores the session token and user object in `localStorage`, then calls `queuePostLoginSync(user.employeeId)` without awaiting it. The UI transitions instantly to the main app.
- `queuePostLoginSync` (also in `public/index.js`) sends `{"userId":"<employeeId>"}` to `https://api-qa.atenxion.ai/integrations/hr/post-login-sync` with a five-second timeout. Errors are logged to the console only.
- If `fetch` is unavailable or the request times out, the code falls back to `navigator.sendBeacon` with the same JSON payload to keep the sync fire-and-forget.
- Microsoft 365 SSO logins also trigger the same sync immediately after their redirect completes.

## Running the portal locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to access the HR portal. The built-in credentials and endpoints remain unchanged; the only addition is the background Atenxion sync that fires after a successful login.

## Security note

For demo purposes the Atenxion bearer token is embedded directly in the client-side code. In production you should proxy this request through your backend or use another secure relay so the token is not exposed to end users.
